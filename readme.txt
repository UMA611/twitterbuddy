DESCRIPTION:
--------------------------------

twitterBuddy is a command-line utility to display updates from the website twitter.com. For twitterBuddy to run, you must have ruby and rubygems installed on your system. Both of these are installed by default on Mac OS X 10.4 and 10.5 (and probably earlier versions as well).

GETTING STARTED
--------------------------------
use the command `twitterbuddy -h` to show the help documentation.



ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
--------------------------------

The idea for twitterBuddy came from using the excellent icalBuddy app, created by Ali Rantakari and found at http://hasseg.org/icalBuddy.



INSTALLATION:
--------------------------------

To install, just double-click on the "install.command" file in Finder (it might
just say "install" if your Finder preferences are set to hide file extensions.)

This script will then be run in Terminal and it will first display you the
locations where twitterBuddy will be installed to and then prompt you to continue.
